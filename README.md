# Wordle Backup
A backup of the original Wordle game just in case NY Times did something to it.

Since the game is just a HTML page with a single JavaScript file, it should be easy to back up the game. And I did!

I did this because The New York Times bought Wordle for $1 milion. If NY Times ruins it or something, this would be the hub for the original game.
